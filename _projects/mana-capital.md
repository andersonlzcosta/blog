# Mana Capital
## Simple web interface that never got its' backend
![mana capital print 1](/assets/img/projects/mana-capital.png)
Currently deployed at [https://manacapital.costa.fyi/](https://manacapital.costa.fyi/).
This project has no source code available.

~~presentation~~
My first payed code after changing career from economist to developer. I was learning by watching YouTube videos, specially Brad Traversy, and then I freelance job appeared by recomended by someone that I don't remember anymore. The project was to develop a platform for people to invest with robot traders. I don't remember much of the rest of the pitch. The sensation of getting paied to code changed everything for me since I was used to do some Excel VBA programming and simple websites for myself.

~~my reponsabilities~~
I ended up using one tutorial to develop the entire interface with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. In the end the project didn't follow through and I never got to start implementing the backend. Thinking back now I think it was for the best, I didn't have the proper knowledge to tackle this project back then.

~~deployment ~~
The deployment was straight foward, easy and free at Netlify. I had to learn how to do it since it was my first time, but not much a of challenge.
