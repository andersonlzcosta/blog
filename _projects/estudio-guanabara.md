# Estudio Guanabara
## Wordpress theme implementation for a architecture studio
![estudio guanabara print 1](/assets/img/projects/estudio-guanabara.png)
Currently deployed at [https://estudioguanabara.com/](https://estudioguanabara.com/).
This project has no source code.

~~presentation~~
This is my most recent project, finished in january of 2024. This was a straight forward Wordpress deployment. It is a artchiteture studio portifolio page. Its’ main content are the latest projects of Guanabara Estudio. I’ve started this project after networking with the owners of the studio as consultant to their infrastructure. They were unhappy with the prices charged by Webflow where it was developed and deployed.

~~my reponsabilities~~ 
My responsabilities were mainly to help the owners to make the best decision when changing their host. Wordpress was a suitable choice as CMS to their needs, easy and cheap to maintain online. Also helped to deploy and setup a backup strategie. I also helped customize the choosen theme which was almost the same layout of the previous one at webflow.

~~deployment ~~
The deployment was easy at the chosen host which was Hostinger, that has a better managing interface than the previous experiences I had with cpanel and Hostgator.
