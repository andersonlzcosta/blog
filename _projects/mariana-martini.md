# Mariana Martini
## Webflow to Wordpress theme to a Italy based architet
![mariana martini print 1](/assets/img/projects/mariana-martini.png)
Maybe currently deployed at [https://marianamartini.it/](https://marianamartini.it/).
Github source code is in private repository.

This was my first project with Vértice. Erik, one of the Vértice founders, helped so much and thought me a lot of how Wordpress works under the hood. He was the one who developed the Webflow and already had lots of Wordpress experience. I already had Webflow experience after designing the webpage of a previous business I had. Then I was introduced to Wordpress framework and it has been quite a useful tool on my belt, several future projects demanded the knowledge.

Since I previously used Webflow, was quite chill to get to understand their HTML/CSS logic, albeit confusing. The rest of the project was all about getting to know Wordpress, the loop and folder structure. With the site exported from Webflow was just a matter of placing each loop on their divs to render the architets projects, almost no CSS styling was needed.

The deployment was made at Hostgator and as my first contact with cPanel was a very interesting learning opportunity, which I used many times to this day. Erik helped all along the way and the process was amazing!!
