This project is not deployable. 
This project has no source code.

This is another project that I participated as Vértice member and quite possibly the most challenging one so far. Given tech support to a entire organization was very difficult and fullfulling. Help to spread the vegetarian message is a very dear purpose. I worked with Erik, one of the Vértice founder, who is a vegetarian and the project had a very deep sense of commitment.

The support was quite broad: help setup landing pages of marketing campaing, updating the server that run ispconfig to deal with all the sites and domains, maintaining a Mautic instance, changing CRM platform, setting up email accounts, minor support to Laravel apps and some more.

The deployments that I need to do was through ISPConfig interface that worked most of times and I learned a lot having full access to the platform as opposing of my other experiences with the locked Hostgator cpanel implementation. All the rest was already deployed once I started. The most of the work was figuring out the bugs in Mautic updates, updating the debian OS underneath the ISPConfig instance and later fixing its' bugs.
