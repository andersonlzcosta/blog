# Maraca Discos
## Nuvemshop setup and customization for vinil records ecommerce
![maraca discos print 1](/assets/img/projects/maraca-discos.png)
Currently deployed at [https://maracadiscos.com/](https://maracadiscos.com/).
This project has no source code available.  
 
I've initially met the vinil shop owner, Edgar, and he need help to setup DNS redirection from his private domain to his profile of a vinyl marketplace and also a custom ecommerce at Wix. Some time after he needed a ecommerce solution to a upcoming realese of a vinyl reprint of a classic brazilian record. After some research we decided to move from the Wix high taxes to a brazilian ecommerce platform called nuvemshop which has better fees and intragation to the local market.

In both of the first wix ecommerce and later nuvemshop, I've setup the entire ecommerce backend and did some design customization. Which were both very tiresome because of the limited interface to do so. The client helped along the way and later populated the database with his inventory of vinyls.
 
Both deployments were quite straight foward with the easy to use to use interface, just requiring some adaptation of the diferent placement of features.
