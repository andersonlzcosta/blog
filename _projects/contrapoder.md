# Contrapoder Magazine
## Wordpress news portal with modified template
![contrapoder print 1](/assets/img/projects/contrapoder.png)
Currently deployed at [https://contrapoder.net/](https://contrapoder.net/).
Github source code is in private repository.

This is my most recent project. It was a straight forward wordpress deployment. It is a left wing portal. Its’ main content is opinion to proeminent leftt thinkers and scholars. I’ve started this project after learning wordpress with Vertice’s founder Erik. I’ve to this day host the infrastructure at Hostgator and manage it. 

I was resposable to adapt a wordpress theme to the client’s given design that was inspired by the theme. The adaptation	required some intervention in the source code and it is still a mainly upgraded through ssh connection. I used the child theme approach to modify the interface and some in theme modifications to acomplish some specific custom entities created to this specific project that the child theme folder couldn’t accommodate. 

The deployment of this project was quite straight forward using hostgator interface. I had to create a VPS instance and hostgator handles the cpanel infrasructure. This makes very easy to add new emails and backup the entire instance. The wordpress instalation was quite a direct process, almost trivial with my current knowledge. I’ve been performing some simple maintenance to this istance, that consist basicly of upgraing the wordpress instalation and regular backups.
