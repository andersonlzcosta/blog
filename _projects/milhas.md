# Milhas pela Vida das Mulheres
## Abortion rights NGO website
![milhas pela vida das mulheres print 1](/assets/img/projects/milhas.png)
Currently deployed at [https://milhas.costa.fyi/](https://milhas.costa.fyi/).
Github source code is in a private repository. 
 

I've met one of the volunteers of the project during my time at VÃ©rtice. The NGO creator need to update their former Angular written site. There was already a design conceived and approved. This project was mainly to develop and maintain the given website.

Since I had free pass to chose the tech involved and I was interested in learning Svelte early hype, that was what I chose. It was quite a fun developer experience and learning a proper fronted framework gave me a lot of confidence to keep persuing the full stack career.

I've chose Netlify to host the project since it is free and saved the NGO's resources. The deployment pipeline was very simple by syncing it with the github repository.
